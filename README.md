- Identify which churn category is accounting for the highest proportion of churn
- Analyze the different demographic fields using nested IF() from the dataset by categorizing age as 'Under 30', 'Other' and 'Senior'

- Investigate how the Unlimited Data Plan influences the churn rate
- Analyze the relationship between customers' international activity and churn
- Investigate the contract type, and how many months a person is a customer
- Create a table matrix that displays churn rate by state and international plan of top 25 states
- Display key information such as total customers, number of churned customers and churn rate
